Description
-----------

DXFLib is a library written in MATLAB that allows to create simple AutoCAD DXF files. Autocad DXF 
is a popular file format that can be interpreted in many CAD-related applications. AutoCAD DXF can 
be also converted to a PDF file containing 3D geometry using any 3D printer driver.

The DXFLib handles DXF layers and ACI Colors (RGB colors are automatically converted to their ACI 
counterparts). It is capable of exporting point, polylines, polysurfaces, text, various 3D 
primitives and 2D markers.

Installation
------------

Just unpack zipped m-files to your working directory or create a separate directory and add its 
location to MATLAB path. All m-files are located in to root directory. The /examples directory 
contains DXF files which are generated by dxf_test.m script. Some DXF files are converted to 3D 
PDF files using Bentley View 3D printer driver.

Usage

The easiest way to learn how to create DXF files using DXFLib is to simply run the dxf_test.m 
script and then open it in MATLAB editor and compare the generated DXF files with the code inside 
the script. Obviously, you'll need any DXF viewer that is capable to handle 3D content. I recommend
to use free Bentley View software (http://www.bentley.com/en-US/Products/Bentley+View/). The 
advantage of using Bentley View is that this software is capable to PRINT 3D PDF 
files (some DXF files in /exaples subdirectory were converted using this 3D PDF printer driver).
